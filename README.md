The following steps will explain how to run the algorithms and the different analyses:
1. In the main.py we intialize the initial state of the puzzle
2. The different algorithms are called with the initial state and to run the algorithms you need to run the main.py
3. To run the analysis on each different algorithms, run the specific python file depending of the algorithm you want to run
4. Each analysis is done with 20 randomized puzzle and will display the performance of the algorithm
