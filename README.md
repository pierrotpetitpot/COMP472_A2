The following steps will explain how to run the algorithms and the different analyses:
1. In the main.py we intialize the initial state of the puzzle which can be changed according to which state you want to run all four algorithms on.
2. The different algorithms are called with that initial state and to run the four algorithms you need to run the main.py
3. To run the analysis on each different algorithm, run the specific python file depending of the algorithm you want to run
4. Finally to run the scaled up algorithms you can change the function call in the aStarScaled.py at the bottom and run that file
5. Each analysis is done with 20 randomized puzzle and will display the performance of the algorithm
